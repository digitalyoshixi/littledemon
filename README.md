**TO CREATE: this is not really an exploit, I made this and then realized that gtk4 probably wouldnt be on the machine, and there is no network access, it is supposed to slow down the PC and run as a daemon process but I gave up halfway**

demon friend on ur linux PC
### Running
This probably requires gtk4 installed, I think.
`./a.out` will run the demon
